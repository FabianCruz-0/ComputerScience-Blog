    I just discovered that I can use <code>html Emmet abreviations</code> on Markdown 
    documents changing the extension settings. It saves me <span class="fw-700">A LOT</span> of time 
    (Good luck formatting the <code>markdown</code> document tho ðŸ’€).

<br>
This is my <code>settings.json</code> of VSC and works pretty neat:
</p>

{% capture some_var %}
{% highlight json linenos %}
{
    "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
    "explorer.confirmDelete": false,
    "editor.minimap.enabled": false,
    "emmet.excludeLanguages": [],
    "emmet.includeLanguages": { "markdown": "html" },
    "emmet.triggerExpansionOnTab": true,
    "[markdown]": {
        "editor.quickSuggestions": {
            "comments": "on",
            "strings": "on",
            "other": "on"
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endcapture %}
{% include fix_linenos.html code=some_var %}

    I'm pretty mad at the Eclipse IDE ðŸ˜‚. I spent a lot of time trying to see why an application 
    was not working correctly and eclipse was not giving any error logs. I tried everything to even 
    log the errors but it just didn't change anything. I got fed up and installed the intelliJ IDE 
    at least to see if I got any errors. After installing the IDE and importing the project, 
    it worked perfectly without changing anything ðŸ˜­. <br>
    It is possible that I did something wrong, but without any information it is difficult to solve it. <br>
    For now I will continue working with intelliJ.
